# Study Abroad Program - Base Nginx Configuration
# This is the main Nginx configuration file that sets up the web server's
# global settings, worker processes, and includes routing configurations.
#
# Key Features:
# - Automatic worker process scaling
# - Optimized connection handling
# - Gzip compression for better performance
# - Logging configuration
# - Security headers
#
# Note: Specific routing rules are in /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Run as nginx user for security
user  nginx;

# Auto-scale worker processes based on CPU cores
worker_processes  auto;

# Error log configuration
error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log notice;
pid        /var/run/nginx.pid;

# Event module configuration
events {
    # Maximum number of simultaneous connections per worker
    worker_connections  1024;
}

# HTTP module configuration
http {
    # MIME type mapping
    include       /etc/nginx/mime.types;

                     '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';
